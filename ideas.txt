* endpoint to database : custom ownership
    -chatgpt instructed to "store" as a new function
    -any time "store" function is invoked chatgpt will store new information to the database
    -many identifiers for what "new" information is
    -when chatgpt determines it cannot know this new information it should attempt to retrieve the field from the database making a query
